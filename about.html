        This blog is a collection of my musings on algorithmic trading and the various strategy ideas I am experimenting with. It is not a polished blog but rather a notebook where I park ideas, half-baked experiments, and anything that sparks my curiosity.

      <p>
        While pursuing my undergraduate degree in Economics, I discovered quant finance and realized how a combination of math, coding, and markets can feel both surreal and practical, more engaging than anything I had studied before. I enjoy building trading strategies, breaking them, refining them, deploying them, and watching them perform. The process is addictive and feels almost like a game.
      </p>

        Beyond finance, I am passionate about sports. I follow football closely, supporting Real Madrid, I have always loved cricket, and recently I have been exploring algo-betting, treating sports odds and match data as another dataset to model. It is very similar to trading, just with goals and wickets instead of price charts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of what you will find here is me trying out strategies, running backtests, or playing with numbers that catch my attention. It is less about giving answers and more about documenting the journey, making sense of the noise, and sharing the occasional insight along the way.
