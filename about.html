      <p>
        I mostly write about trading, stats, and whatever math trick I’m experimenting with at the moment. 
        Think of this space as a mix of quant notes and random musings I’ve explored in quant finance.

      <p>
        I didn’t exactly plan to end up in the quant space until high school. 
        I actually started out in economics during my first year at IIT Roorkee—drawn to big-picture questions 
        about markets and policy. But somewhere along the way, I stumbled into the world of quant. 
        Suddenly it wasn’t just about theories; it was about math, code, and turning abstract ideas 
        into something that could be traded.
